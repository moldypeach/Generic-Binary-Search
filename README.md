Generic-Binary-Search
=====================

Binary Search

A binary search requires that the array be in sorted order.  Assume that you have an unsorted array to start with and 
implement a function to sort the array.  Then use the sorted array to implement your generic binary search.  This will 
require that you modify a program listing from the book to accommodate generic data types.  Once you have modified the 
search function you need to run it against three different data types (int, double and string) and produce a report that 
shows the unsorted and sorted arrays for each type.  Your test arrays should have at least 10 elements in each array.  
You will also need some interface that allows the user to search for the key value. Remember to use good programming 
techniques â€“ a generic search routine is designed to be re-used, so be sure that you structure your program to enhance 
object re-use, as well.  Also, remember that your signature block must appear on every page of output.
You are required to use generic programming for the search, but it is optional (but recommended) for the sorts.
